// This version we got rid of error and had to add in line 8 however  you have to type in local not the blue drop down box ill have to  find out  how to add that code in and well be a step closer. I'm working on a 3 part script here but trying to learn so thisis part 2. 
//LSL LSL will allow aperson to  touch an object then gives a  blue drop down box that you can type  a message in and will display float text for 24 hours.


default{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llListen(1,"",NULL_KEY,"");
        llDialog(llDetectedKey(0), "Type your message:", ["OK"], 1);
    }
    
 // below is how long to  have floating text show in seconds and  color when to stop.

   listen(integer channel, string name, key id, string message)
    {
        llSetText(message, <0.0, 0.0, 1.0>, 1.0);
        llSetTimerEvent(60);
    }
 
    timer()
    {
        llSetText("", <1.0, 1.0, 1.0>, 1.0);
        llSetTimerEvent(0);
    }
}
